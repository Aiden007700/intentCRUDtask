This is an updated version of the same task that I got two years ago, the old repository can be found under this link: https://github.com/Aiden007700/infullmobile


I took the old repository and updated it to use React functional components, I also refactored it to use TypeScript. 

There are many improvements that I would make if I was to work on this longer.

To name just a few:
1) refactor Add / Edit they could have been refactored into one file. 
2) use styled-components (but the instructions ask not to use any libraries) 
3) various UX & QOL improvements ex, an enter button for ingredients 

As instructed I did not use any component library for CSS, and I did not use any javascript library (except for UUID) as I had no way to download them at the time. 

Best,
Aiden Campbell
